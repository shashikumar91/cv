    <h3> Career Highlights</h3>
    <h4>As a Technical support Engineer below are the highlights of the responsibilities:</h4>
</div>

<div class="highlightlist">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Analyse issues reported by the clients and trace the issue back to the root
            and provide the Root cause analysis to the client. The analysis would
            include gathering the basic information and depending on the issue type,
            use the collected information to perform certain actions relevant to the
            issue, such as collecting server logs, analyse logs using shell scripting .
            Perform Network troubleshooting and engage relevant teams in case if
            more information from other teams is required to move forward. This
            applies to issues during the Site Down situation. The site can be down for
            numerous reasons starting from issues with DNS querying , TCP
            handshake failure, SSL/TLS handshake failure to HTTP connection
            failure. Take suitable steps to troubleshoot the issues and provide
            mitigation to the client.
        </li>
        <li>
            The CDN also provides Web Application Firewall services where you
            can add a layer of security at the CDN level. WAF provides protection for
            OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks and also includes an option to
            set up Custom Rules in case if we need a special/new rule. WAF also
            provides an Access control list to maintain a list of IPs or IP ranges to
            allow or block the requests coming from the suspected client. Bot
            Management is also part of the WAF where you can control the Bot
            activity on your site. When the issue is reported it will involve analysing
            the Security reports and pulling and analysing the server logs and Identify
            if it is a false positive or a real attack., take immediate action to mitigate
            by adding the suspicious IPs(ranges) to the blacklist. In case if the attack
            is related to the OWASP 10 security risk we can Fine tune WAF by adding
            exceptions/filters to the rules based on identifying if it is a false positive or
            real attack.
        </li>
        <li>
            The PKI technology is used to create and maintain SSL/TLS
            certificates on the CDN. These certificates are used during the SSL/TLS
            handshake from the client's browser and the CDN server. The certificate
            renewal process needs to be completed before the expiry date, to complete
            the renewal process a CSR is generated which would include the
            information about the client's domain and organisation details and will be
            submitted to the Certificate Authority (CA) for further steps. The CA
            verifies the client domain by using publicly available information of the
            client from the internet sources such as google. The CA will next reach out
            to the WHOIS contacts of the client for domain validation . The client will
            have to take certain steps provided by the CA to show ownership of the
            domain and once this is verified the CA issues the certificate back to the
            CDN and can be used by the live traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
            Site performance drop investigations can be done live by using the
            browser developer tools and inspect timing or use Timing APIs by
            google to measure performance. Use tools such as Web page test or
            Light house to Monitor or get stats which can help analyse for any
            latencies in the browser level. Verify if the latency could be due to the CDN
            network by analysing the server logs and inspecting the times taken values
            such as TTFB , T urn a round t ime or T ransfer t ime and isolate the
            component where the delay is caused
        </li>
        <li>
            The CDN also provides DNS services where the client can use the CDN as
            a Primary or Secondary DNS provider . The Primary DNS servers host the
            master DNS servers where the zone records are originally configured and
            will perform a Zone transfer to the Secondary\Replicated DNS servers by
            using a query mechanism AXFR . This is a type of DNS query that is used
            to replicate the DNS zone records across a set of DNS servers and this
            mechanism uses a reliable TCP connection to transfer the zone records
            whereas the DNS querying uses UDP which uses an asynchronous method
            to send packets. Analyse DNS issues by performing relevant checks for all
            different issues. Analyse logs, Review DNS reports, Inspect SOA record to
            verify if latest DNS servers contain the latest zone file. The SOA record will
            contain zone transfer details such as serial number which is a unique
            number that tells us if the zone is the latest. The serial number on the
            replicated server will be compared with the serial number on the master
            server, in case if the replicated servers are not updated we can manually
            run a query using AXFR to fetch the latest zone file.
